Editor1
=======

My first text editor. It has a lot of deficiencies, but
works on some level. Hopefully, editor2 will be better.

To compile it, run:
$ cc main.c -o editor1

Then, you can open a temporary buffer with:
$ editor1

or edit a file with:
$ editor /path/to/my/file

Navigate the editor with error keys.

Quit with Ctrl-Q.
Save to a file with Ctrl-S.
Press Ctrl-F to search, and the arrow keys to navigate between results.
